# Real-Estate-Prediction-Model
A Real-Estate-Prediction-Model based on Pune's Real Estate properties, created using Linear regression and Data Cleaning Techniques.

A web application designed to predict real estate prices across Pune, India. This project combines a user-friendly frontend with a machine learning backend to provide instant property value estimations.

Key Features:

Responsive Frontend: A clean, split-screen UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to easily input property details like area, BHK, and location.

Machine Learning Core: The backend is powered by a Python Flask server, which uses a pre-trained Scikit-learn (Linear Regression) model to calculate price predictions.

Live Location Data: The location dropdown is dynamically populated by fetching the latest data from the server.

User-Friendly Validation: Includes client-side checks to guide users and ensure valid data is submitted.
